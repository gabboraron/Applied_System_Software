Your total score depends on 3 factors:
-  All works completed on time, observing ORTUS deadlines - 30%
-  Two tests that will be evaluated with a mark - 30%
-  Final exam in the Online environment - 40%.

## What is application and what is Software
requireeÃ³ments are constantly changing

Lifecycle
- conception
- childhood
- adulthood
- retirement


which activites should we select forthe software project? what are the dependencies between them? how should we schedule the activites?

funcional modeling of software lifecycl
- scenarios
- use case model

structural modeling of software lifecycle
- object identification
- class diagrams

dynamic modeling of software

questions:
- What is the problem?
- what is the solution?
- what are the best mechanisms to implement? - languages/API
- how is the solution constructed? - 
- is the roblem solved?
- can costumeruse the slution?
- how dowe deal with changes?

soft dev activities:
- requirements
- system design
- detailed design
- program implenetation
- testing
- delivery
- maintenence

## requirement analysis
bridging gap between system requirements enineering ad  software design

- sstem information
- function
- behavior

model -> data

**objectives:**
- identify customer's needs
- evaluate system for feasibility
- perform economic and technical analysis
- allocate functions to system elements
- estabilish schedule and constraints
- create system definitions

**software requirements analysis phases:**
1. **problem recognition:** what do you want to solve
2. **evaluation and synthesis**: how it is implemented, what kind of models do we used for
3. **modeling:** how and what system can handle it? 
4. **specification**
5. **review**

management questions:
- how much effort put towards analysis?
- who does the analysis?
- whhy is it so difficult?
- who pays for it?

**feasibility study:**
- economic feasiblity: cost benefit analysis
- technical: hardware/software/people
- legal:what acan we do, GDPR, etc
- alterantives: there is always more than one way to do it

**system specification:**
- functional data tdescription
- subsystem description
- system modeling and simulation results
- products
- appendices

**requirements:** 
- features of system or function used to fulifill system purpose
- focus on user's needs and not on solution

**types ofrequirements:**
- **functional**
  - input/output
  - processing
  - error handling
- **non functional requirements**
  - physical enviroment
  - interfaces
  - user/human factors
  
**requirement  definition:**
- general purpos of document
- system background and objectives
- description of approach
- detailed characersitics

**software requirements elicitation**
- customer meetings are most commonly usued 
- context free 

***FAST**
- fascilitated application specification technque
- meeting between customer and dev at neutral site
- gals:
  - identify probelem
  - propose elements of solution
  - negotiae different appproaches
  - specify preliminary set of requirements

**QFD**
- quality function development
- customer's needs impply technical requirements:
  - normal requirements
  - expected requirements
  - exciting requirements

**use cases**
- scenraios that describe how the product will be used
- written narratives that describe the role of an actor
- use cass designed from the actor's point of view
- not all actors can be identified during the fst iteration of requirements 
- identify the firs actors feore creating the first use-cases

**profiels:**
- full control: administrator
- read/write/modify all manager
- read/write/modify own inspector
- read only

**information domain**
- encompasses all data objects that contain numbers text images audio or video
- content/data model
- information flow
- information structure

**modelling**
- data model
- functional model
- behavioral model

**specificrepresentation**
- representation format and content
- information contained within the specification should be nested
- diagrams and other noational forms should be restricted in number and consistent use

**specfication**
- conducted by custemer and software developer
- once approved the specs becomes a contract for software development
- the specification is difficult to test in a meaningful way
- assessing the impact of specification changes is hard to do
